    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Lorenzo Agostini, a finance major at Brigham Young University's Marriott Business School, originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Growing up in the heart of such a dynamic business environment, I was surrounded by diverse cultures and the buzz of opportunities which kindled my interest in investments and resource management.</p>

<p>My father  has run a business supplying products to restaurants, where I learned the importance of hard work, sound financial principles, and ethical practices. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my desire to uphold our family's legacy of good ethics and partnership.</p>

<p>Before my university education, I dedicated two years to volunteer service for my faith, which was not only fulfilling but also set a solid foundation for my personal and professional growth. In my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in investment banking and urban planning investments, sectors I plan to explore further after graduation.</p>

<p>Apart from my professional pursuits, I am an ardent soccer fan, cheering for Palmeiras every chance I get. I cherish time spent with my wife cooking Italian cuisine and delving into various cultures and histories, enriching our lives with the flavors and stories from around the world.</p>

<p>I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn from others as well.</p>

<h1>What moves me</h1>
<p>Below here is a graph and also video that can help you understand my views on societies and markets. I grew up in a nation with great potencial, but also with deep issues such as corruption. I believe that as you and I as individuals and societies become increasingly just and focused on helping one another our nations can become a better place for us all. As you will see, countries with less corruption also experience economic development. To me that is not a coincidence! </p>
